# Pokemon
my bad port of pokemon showdown for the pc even though it's already on pc
This is actually being turned into a fully fledged pokemon game, which is why there is empty extra files
Also, you need to unzip the sprites file and take the frontsprites and backsprites files out of it and place it in your python folder
